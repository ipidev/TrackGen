# TrackGen

**TrackGen** is a web-based tool that randomly generates fully-playable maps for [Trackmania (2020)](https://www.trackmania.com/), right down to naming it for you! The generator is capable of using most blocks available in the game and connects them together correctly. The generation parameters are highly customisable and allow you to fine-tune the sorts of tracks that can appear.

While the map files are not generated directly, the display will enable you to recreate the map inside Trackmania's built-in editor. I also encourage that you decorate it before saving!

[The latest version of TrackGen is hosted on my website](https://www.ipidev.net/trackgen/).
